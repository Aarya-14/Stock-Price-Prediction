# Stock-Price-Prediction using LSTM

## Project Overview
This project applies Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast future stock prices using historical time series data. It showcases how deep learning can model sequential patterns in financial data for short-term trend prediction.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras (LSTM layer)

## ðŸ“Š Workflow
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Feature scaling and sequence preparation  
3. LSTM model design and training  
4. Evaluation and prediction visualization

## Model Insights
The LSTM model effectively captures temporal dependencies in stock price movements. Results are visualized to compare predicted and actual values, helping assess model performance intuitively.
